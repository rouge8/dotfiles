These are my dotfiles. They're pretty exciting.

There's an uninstaller and an installer too.

Some of the scripts in `bin` assume you have [requests](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/), [clint](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/clint/), and [BeautifulSoup4](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4/4.1.1).

You can install them however, but I recommend `pip install --user requests clint bs4`
