# dotfiles

This is [my](http://andyfreeland.net) collection of dotfiles. It's
managed by a [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/rouge8/dotfiles-base/)
script that automatically symlinks files into `$HOME` from multiple
dotfiles repositories.

## Installation

To install, you must already have the
[`dotfiles`](https://github.com/rouge8/dotfiles-base/) script
installed.  Then, just clone the repo and run:

    $ dotfiles install
